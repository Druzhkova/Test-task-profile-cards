### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

#### Requirements
Node.js  
To get started install Node.js for your platform if it's not there.

#### The quick guide to get Node.js installed:

- open the official page for [Node.js downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download Node.js by clicking the "Installer" option;
- run the downloaded Node.js .msi Installer - including accepting the license, selecting the destination, and authenticating for the install:
  - this requires Administrator privileges, and you may need to authenticate;
- to ensure Node.js has been installed, run node -v in your terminal - you should get something like v14.15.5;
- update your version of npm with npm install npm --global:
  - this requires Administrator privileges, and you may need to authenticate.
